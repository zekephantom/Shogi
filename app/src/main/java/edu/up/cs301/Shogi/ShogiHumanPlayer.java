 * A GUI of a counter-player. The GUI displays the current value of the counter,

 * send moves to the game.
 * 
 * Just for fun, the GUI is implemented so that if the player presses either button
 * when the counter-value is zero, the screen flashes briefly, with the flash-color
 * being dependent on whether the player is player 0 or player 1.
